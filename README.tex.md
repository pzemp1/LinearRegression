# Linear Regression

A unique perspective of Linear Regression. 

My current interests are financial markets, now I will be looking to use Linear Regression as a technique to look at financial data from a different perspective. 
I want to look at what sort of data I can extract using Linear Regression. Investigate the changes in parameters, measurements of quality of fit, using different criterias
to model quality of fit and looking at the overall changes in the regression model. 

My first take will look at the changes in slope. Looking at the changes in slope when regressing time against price data will reveal?
